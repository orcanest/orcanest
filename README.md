I work as a Junior DevOps Engineer, bridging the gap between development and operations. My primary focus is on implementing and managing CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes. I use tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment. </br>
I also work with Infrastructure as Code, using Terraform or CloudFormation to provision and manage cloud resources on AWS. A key part of my role is setting up monitoring and logging with the ELK stack or Prometheus/Grafana to track system health and performance. I'm building my skills in cloud-native technologies and Linux administration to help create scalable and resilient systems.
